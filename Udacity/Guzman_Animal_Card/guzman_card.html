			<p id="second">Augis are a very hardy breed of dog and usually have a long life span. They are very healthy animals when given proper care. Since both the australian shepard and the welsh corgi come from a long line of working farm dogs they augis are excellent workers. They would make the perfect animal for any farmer. Even if you do not have a farm they are still an excellent pet. The make wonderful family pets and are very social. They make wonderful baby sitters for children when they are playing outside if trained to do so. They will keep small children from leaving a safe play area. This may sound a little strange but it is a good way to keep your children safer. They will not hurt the children.</p>
